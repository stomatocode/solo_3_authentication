How to not suck at phase 2

Jared -> work on main challenges before solos, apples, remember to push to github often

Clint -> wait if you're stuck on somethings, do the cores in the meantime, definitely take a couple hours when you have the time to finish the tutorials (try jquery, et al), don't be down on yourself, positive attitude. Don't think about what I 'should' do, instead about what I 'will' do. Blindfolds

Christine -> start with someone leading you through the cores to get familiar (it's ok if you don't know something, don't be afraid to ask questions, don't get overwhelmed)

Cole -> get familiar with doing stuff in the console, console.log everything. Ditch the attitude, it's a distraction for everyone around you.
